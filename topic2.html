					<h1 id="content">Effective Business Language</h1>
					<h2>The etiquette of business communication is a complex amalgam of tact, formality, practicality, accuracy and culture. This is the minefield of not just what we say, but how we say it.</h2>
					<h2>Knowing and using the unwritten rules of business language can make a difference in how our message is received, perceived and responded to.</h2>
					<h2>This topic explores these underlying concepts.</h2>
					<h3>Intended Learning</h3>
					<p>This topic will provide a basic understanding of the core elements of proper business language in a professional context. Students will learn about the psychological effects of spelling and grammatical errors, sentence construction, punctuation and how to change the phraseology for maximum effect. We will discuss the purpose of language and how to shape it as a tool using intent, focus and purpose.</p>
					<p>This topic also looks at the fundamental rules of communication in written formats. We look at the underlying mechanics at work in any written exchange.</p>
					<h3>Threshold Concepts</h3>
					<p>When considering the most important discoverings of any topic, the threshold concepts are those which will irreversibly change the way you think about the subject from here on. The following are considered threshold concepts that, once understood, will forever change your understanding.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The language we use is a representation of our character, attitude and competence. It is our PERSONA when we are not there in person.</li>
					<li>A reader will form a mental RESPONSE to every sentence, paragraph and point that they read just as they would in a personal dialogue. They judge every line.</li>
					<li>The MESSAGE is the only thing which the reader will allow to influence them by virtue of their reading it. It is our only tool to influence them.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Questions to Ponder</h3>
					<p>Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them to others.</p>
					<ul><li>What effect does spelling and grammar have on our perceived credibility as an author?</li>
					<li>What is the effect of exaggeration, dramatic or emotional language in business writing?</li>
					<li>How might saying too much undermine our attempts at conveying understanding?</li>
					<li>What do we mean when we say that all reading of authored writing is actually a dialogue?</li>
					<li>What are the roles of a sentence, paragraph and section/page in the creation of a message?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Considerations and Observations</h3>
					<p>As we explore communication theory take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.</p>
					<ul><li>Opinion should be carefully used in business and in a factual and controlled manner.</li>
					<li>The reader is constantly judging the message and the author whilst reading, including judging whether or not to keep reading.</li>
					<li>It is entirely the authorâ€™s responsibility to write with the intention to remove all obstacles to the understanding of the reader.</li>
					<li>We generally want to strike a fine balance between emotional engagement and intellectual engagement within a reader.</li>
					<li>The purpose of a message is to create an alignment of understanding in the reader.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="task">Activity Task</h3>
					<p>To practice this topic and to embed its knowledge students should conduct the following task. Do this in your own time when the opportunity arises. </p>
					<p class="ind">Choose two pieces of written communications you read this week, one which was very clear to you and one which was not.</p>
					<p class="ind">Identify the reasons why the clear communications worked - what did it do well. Which of the concepts in this topic did this message use well?</p>
					<p class="ind">Consider the failed message, and which of the key points from this topic that could have helped improve it. Decide how that message could have been written to better effect.</p>
