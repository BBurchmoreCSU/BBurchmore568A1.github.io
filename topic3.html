					<h1 id="content">Online Interactions</h1>
					<h2>Email revolutionised much of the way we communicated in business. Since then other tools such as instant messaging, internet voice chat, web site text chat, and video conferencing have all added to the electronic options available to us.</h2>
					<h2>Whilst these tools can often be very convenient, it is often this very fact that can make them intrusive, annoying or overwhelming to some. </h2>
					<h2>These types of communication also suffer from a wide range of reactions depending on the familiarity (and age group) of the people they are aimed at.</h2>
					<h3>Intended Learning</h3>
					<p>Students will learn about some of the current tools available to enhance your electronic communications as well as how to use them effectively. In addition we will explore their weaknesses, how and when not to use them, and what reactions they might cause in others. We will also examine how these tools can impact business productivity and communication effectiveness.</p>
					<h3>Threshold Concepts</h3>
					<p>When considering the most important discoverings of any topic, the threshold concepts are those which will irreversibly change the way you think about the subject from here on. The following are considered threshold concepts that, once understood, will forever change your understanding.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Each email should contain a single, simple message. CONCISE is the most important criteria.</li>
					<li>We should assume that we have ZERO control, authority or influence over what we put online.</li>
					<li>In digital media, the USER EXPERIENCE is the real product and the message.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Questions to Ponder</h3>
					<p>Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them to others.</p>
					<ul><li>What are the ideal circumstances to use email for communications?</li>
					<li>What forms of language should we avoid using in email?</li>
					<li>What is the main purpose of function of instant messaging in professional communications?</li>
					<li>What are the three vectors of change in the digital user experience?</li>
					<li>How do we create each type of change in the user?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Considerations and Observations</h3>
					<p>As we explore communication theory take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.</p>
					<ul><li>Email is a legally representative form of communications.</li>
					<li>Social media should be considered a public forum where we use our most professional language.</li>
					<li>Instant messaging has specific etiquette intended to ensure that others will respond to us effectively.</li>
					<li>In order for any digital media or message to do its job it must affect the user or recipient in all three vectors of change.</li>
					<li>The concepts and process of experiential response to any stimuli are subconscious.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Listening Resources</h3>
					<p>Download or listen directly to the following audio files.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_3A_Email.mp3">Lecture_3A_Email.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_3B_Social_Media.mp3">Lecture_3B_Social_Media.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_3C_User_Experience.mp3">Lecture_3C_User_Experience.mp3</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="task">Activity Task</h3>
					<p>To practice this topic and to embed its knowledge students should conduct the following task. Do this in your own time when the opportunity arises. </p>
					<p class="ind">Consider an email or instant message conversation that you had this week which should perhaps have been done via another medium. Explore the reasons why this communications used the wrong medium, and why it should have used another.</p>
					<p class="ind">Review an email you received this week that went against some of the concepts in this topic. Consider the effects of this upon you as the reader, and what that would mean for the sender as a consequence.</p>
					<p class="ind">Consider an online post that you saw this week which you feel would reflect poorly on the one who posted it. Note the reasons why that person might eventually regret their post.</p>
