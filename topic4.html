					<h1 id="content">Influence via Big Documents</h1>
					<h2>All commercial or professional environments will at some point rely upon important written documents which will greatly influence major decisions. Proposals showcase ideas and opportunities and try to influence decision makers to make particular changes for a particular journey. </h2>
					<h2>Reports attempt to summarise the truth as it is now to feed into decisions about how to respond to that truth.</h2>
					<h2>Together these two types of written document shape much of what happens in any organisation.</h2>
					<h3>Intended Learning</h3>
					<p>Students will learn how to recognise, create and interpret effective proposals and reports. Theoretical and practical aspects of proposal structural design will be explored. Details of how to create influence and persuasion within written documents will be examined.</p>
					<p>Students will also gain an understanding of how reports can be created and used to effectively influence decisions. Students will improve their mastery over some of the most influential documents that typically shape an organisation’s future.</p>
					<h3>Threshold Concepts</h3>
					<p>When considering the most important discoverings of any topic, the threshold concepts are those which will irreversibly change the way you think about the subject from here on. The following are considered threshold concepts that, once understood, will forever change your understanding.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The BASELINE LOGIC of a proposal is its most important structural attribute.</li>
					<li>For any large document the EXEC SUMMARY is its most crucial section, and may take as much time to craft as the rest of the document combined.</li>
					<li>Reports should only exist to service a DECISION, and in most cases only the summary or the report will actually be used to do so.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Questions to Ponder</h3>
					<p>Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them to others.</p>
					<ul><li>What are the six slots of a complete proposal document?</li>
					<li>How are slots different from sections in a document?</li>
					<li>What are T.H.E.M.E.S. in the context of written persuasion?</li>
					<li>What are the three key principles we should write with when trying to influence a reader?</li>
					<li>What is meant by the phrase “the summary is the report, the report is the summary”.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Considerations and Observations</h3>
					<p>As we explore communication theory take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.</p>
					<ul><li>All slots in a proposal structure must be represented somewhere in the document.</li>
					<li>Barriers to persuasion are much the same as barriers to understanding.</li>
					<li>The more we try to influence directly the less influence we usually have.</li>
					<li>Effective reports are those which are purpose built to serve particular decisions.</li>
					<li>Data is useless, information is useful, knowledge is useful to me, but a report must be useful to me here and now.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Listening Resources</h3>
					<p>Download or listen directly to the following audio files.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_4A_Proposal_Structure.mp3">Lecture_4A_Proposal_Structure.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_4B_Written_Persuasion.mp3">Lecture_4B_Written_Persuasion.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="/mp3/Lecture_4C_Effective_Reporting.mp3">Lecture_4C_Effective_Reporting.mp3</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="task">Activity Task</h3>
					<p>To practice this topic and to embed its knowledge students should conduct the following task. Do this in your own time when the opportunity arises. </p>
					<p class="ind">Examine an old proposal document. Consider how that document contained a baseline logic, or if it had the required slots. What was missing?</p>
					<p class="ind">Review the executive summary of a proposal and compare it to the rest of the document. How well did that summary capture the THEME of the proposal?</p>
					<p class="ind">Do a brief audit of the types and extent of reporting you are directly involved with. Make an estimate of the amount of that reporting that is actually used to improve decision making in your organisation. How much reporting is wasted?</p>
