					<h1 id="content">Understanding the Concepts</h1>
					<h2>The core concepts of communication theory are as varied and as complex as the human mind upon which they are based. These are the principles that give us both a reason to make the effort to understand them, and the tools with which to improve how we use them.</h2>
					<h2>Once unlocked, the basic ideas behind why communication works (or doesnâ€™t) can reveal surprising ways to quickly and effectively  improve our own.</h2>
					<h2>This topic explores these underlying concepts.</h2>
					<h3>Intended Learning</h3>
					<p>This topic will explore some of the core principles of communication theory. Students will gain an understanding of how the functions of the brain influence communications, of how mindset and disposition can influence outcomes, and will examine the objectives of effective communications in a cognitive context.</p>
					<h3>Threshold Concepts</h3>
					<p>When considering the most important discoverings of any topic, the threshold concepts are those which will irreversibly change the way you think about the subject from here on. The following are considered threshold concepts that, once understood, will forever change your understanding.</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Any breakdown in communications is ALWAYS the responsibility of the communicator.</li>
					<li>CONTEXT is usually the most important, and most absent, element of communications.</li>
					<li>It is not what we say, or even what they hear, that matters - it is how they FEEL about what they thought we meant.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Questions to Ponder</h3>
					<p>Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them to others.</p>
					<ul><li>Why do so many people limit their investment in communications or its improvement?</li>
					<li>What is disposition and reciprocation and how do they influence communications?</li>
					<li>What are the fundamental principles of neuroscience that define how we think?</li>
					<li>What are the differences between data, information, knowledge and understanding?</li>
					<li>What are the three vectors of change and what do they represent?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Considerations and Observations</h3>
					<p>As we explore communication theory take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.</p>
					<ul><li>The ability and intention to predict the path of any communication has a direct and significant impact on the degree of understanding it can transfer.</li>
					<li>Current research shows significant neural alignment in the brain when two people are communicating meaningfully.</li>
					<li>The core purpose of communication is nothing less than complete and effective understanding of the content for all recipients.</li>
					<li>All of the challenges we face with thinking are the same we face with communicating and they are all based on the way the brain is built.</li>
					<li>The most important ingredient for building better communication skills is simply the belief that the benefits available are worth the investment.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Listening Resources</h3>
					<p>Download or listen directly to the following audio files.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="mp3/Lecture_1A_Interaction_Theory.mp">Lecture_1A_Interaction_Theory.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="mp3/Lecture_1B_Cognitive_Comms.mp3">Lecture_1B_Cognitive_Comms.mp3</a></li>
					<li><a href="mp3/Lecture_1C_Knowledge_Exchange.mp3">Lecture_1C_Knowledge_Exchange.mp3</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3 id="task">Activity Task</h3>
					<p>To practice this topic and to embed its knowledge students should conduct the following task. Do this in your own time when the opportunity arises. </p>
					<p class="ind">Consider some examples of failed communications you have experienced over the space of a week. It can be any situation where you are the sender or recipient.</p>
					<p class="ind">Identify three to five of the concepts covered in this topic which were behind the reasons why that communication failed.</p>
					<p class="ind">Decide and make notes on how you might have used those concepts, with the benefit of hindsight, to have improved the communications outcome.</p>
